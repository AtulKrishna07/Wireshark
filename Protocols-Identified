## 1. DNS (Domain Name System)
Purpose: DNS translates domain names like google.com or play.google.com into IP addresses that computers use to communicate.

Your Capture Shows:

Multiple DNS standard queries for domains like beacons.gcp.gvt2.com, e2c56.gcp.gvt2.com, and play.google.com.

Corresponding DNS responses with A (IPv4) and AAAA (IPv6) records.

Port Used: UDP/53

Importance: DNS is essential for internet browsing. It allows users to use domain names instead of memorizing IP addresses.

## 2. HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)

Purpose: HTTP is the foundational protocol used for transferring web pages and other resources over the internet.

Your Capture Shows:

HTTP GET and HEAD requests to download .json and .exe files (e.g., driver update checks).

Status codes like 301 Moved Permanently indicating redirection.

Port Used: TCP/80

Importance: HTTP facilitates communication between clients (browsers) and web servers, although it's plaintext and not secure (unlike HTTPS).

## 3. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)

Purpose: TCP is a connection-oriented protocol that ensures reliable data delivery between two devices.

Your Capture Shows:

The TCP 3-way handshake: SYN → SYN-ACK → ACK

TLSv1.2/1.3 traffic riding over TCP — showing secure web communications in progress.

ACKs, FIN, and application data packets.

Port Used: Varies (common: 443 for HTTPS, 80 for HTTP)

Importance: TCP guarantees packet delivery in the correct order, critical for applications like web browsing, email, and secure communications.

## 4. UDP (User Datagram Protocol)

Purpose: UDP is a lightweight, connectionless transport protocol used for applications that require fast transmission (e.g., DNS queries, video streaming, online games).

Key Observations:

Source IP: 192.168.1.2 sending data to port 6667, a commonly known port used for IRC (Internet Relay Chat) or other services.

Broadcast traffic is also visible (255.255.255.255), which is often used in device discovery or service announcements.

UDP does not guarantee delivery or order — it's fast but unreliable by design.

## 5. ICMPv6 (Internet Control Message Protocol v6)

Purpose: ICMPv6 is used for diagnostic and control messages in IPv6 networks. It includes functions like ping (echo request/reply), router advertisement, neighbor discovery, and error reporting.

Key Observations:

Packet Too Big messages were observed, which indicate the MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit) is too small for certain packets — often a sign of Path MTU Discovery.

Multiple neighbor solicitation/advertisement packets, typical of IPv6's address resolution mechanism.

The use of ff02:: addresses suggests link-local multicast communication.

## 6. QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections)

Purpose: QUIC is a modern transport layer protocol developed by Google, designed to improve HTTP/3 performance. It runs over UDP and provides reliable, encrypted, and multiplexed connections.

Key Observations:

Port 443 indicates encrypted web traffic (HTTPS over QUIC).

Several packets labeled Initial, Handshake, and Protected Payload — showing the secure session setup and data transfer.

QUIC provides built-in encryption (like TLS) and faster handshakes compared to traditional TCP+TLS.
